### Everything for everyone: An Oral History of the New York Commune, 2052-2072 by M. E. O'Brien and Eman Abdelhadi - [https://www.commonnotions.org/everything-for-everyone](https://www.commonnotions.org/everything-for-everyone)
A fictional oral history of “communized” New York City after the global collapse of capitalism. I
have come to think of this book as a future that could follow from the world the Dave’s Lesbian
Bar organizers and participants are creating. It’s also just an excellent speculative novel, and I think you should read it.

### "A Spatial History of Lesbian Bars in New York City" by Gwendolyn Stegall
If you’re interested in NYC lesbian history, then read this immediately! This is a master’s thesis that chronicles lesbian bars in New York City from the 1950s through 2019. If you live in NYC, you’re likely to learn that a building you know used to be a lesbian space. You can download it for free at the link in the citation. Access at [https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-k46h-fa23](https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-k46h-fa23).

### The Stonewall Reader edited by Baumann, J., White, E., & New York Public Library - [Penguin Random House](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/576364/the-stonewall-reader-by-edited-by-the-new-york-public-library-foreword-by-edmund-white-edited-with-an-introduction-by-jason-baumann/)
The Stonewall Reader is a compilation of short, readable excerpts from historical sources about Stonewall and the Stonewall Riots. This book is a good introduction to New York City queer history from many voices. Highly recommended by narrator Sarose Klein!

### A Queer New York : Geographies of Lesbians, Dykes, and Queers by Jen Jack Gieseking - [https://nyupress.org/9781479835737/a-queer-new-york/](https://nyupress.org/9781479835737/a-queer-new-york/)
Through years of both archival and interview-based research about lesbians and queers in New York City, Gieseking argues that queer spatial construction is not a matter of “gayborhoods” but rather of constellations across the city. He proposes that neighborhood-based conceptions of queers space are inherently colonial and capitalist since they are based on access to property. I haven't read this deeply yet, but I think this will inform my thinking as I continue working on the Dave's oral history.

### "Black Trans People Have Been Modeling Mutual Aid Before It Became a Buzzword" by Bailey on Autostraddle

zzword/
A short reported piece on how Black trans people have been engaging in mutual aid strategies both historically and in recent history and why.

[https://addressesproject.com/memory](https://addressesproject.com/memory) - A lesbian and queer memory project about New York City from the early 1900s to today. The project uses oral history, mapping, archiving, portraiture, and events to record and present community memories.

#### Tell Me About That World
[https://tellmeaboutthatworld.org/](https://tellmeaboutthatworld.org/) - 
The Oral History Master’s (OMHA) thesis of my friend and classmate Taylor Thompson, whose work and ideas in the 2020 OHMA cohort greatly influenced mine. Tell Me About That World is an oral history project in which Taylor interviewed leaders in mutual aid and community care organizations in New York City and asked them to imagine better worlds. She then crafted a Black Feminist Listening Practice that encourages audiences to listen deeply to the project’s narrators in order to “hone our own capacities to dream deliberately about liberatory futures.”
