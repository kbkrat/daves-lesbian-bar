##About the oral history project
The Dave’s Lesbian Bar Oral History is an oral history in progress for a lesbian bar in progress. I completed the first four interviews as part of my masters thesis in oral history. The major themes of queerness, Astoria, music, and mutual aid emerged from these interviews. I hope to keep interviewing queers in Astoria as pop-up events continue, as the bar opens in a brick and mortar space, and beyond. Are you an Astoria queer who wants to be interviewed or do you know an Astoria queer who should be interviewed for the oral history? Click on “Get Involved” on the site menu.
