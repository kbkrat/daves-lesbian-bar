## About the oral history project
The Dave’s Lesbian Bar Oral History is an oral history in progress for a lesbian bar in progress. Major themes include queerness, Astoria, music, and mutual aid. Kae hopes to keep interviewing queers in Astoria as pop-up events continue, as the bar opens in a brick and mortar space, and beyond. Are you an Astoria queer who wants to be interviewed or do you know an Astoria queer who should be interviewed for the oral history? Click on [“Get Involved”](https://daveshistory.nyc/get-involved) on the site menu. Kae completed these interviews as part of their masters thesis in oral history.

The edited audio on this website was originally intended for release in May 2023, but life, covid, and the state of the world got in the way. I'm happy to be releasing it now in May 2024!

## About Dave’s Lesbian Bar

## About the oral historian
Kae Bara Kratcha is a white queer millennial who has lived in Astoria, Queens since 2015. They are a librarian both in their day job and in their general vibe. Kae enjoys sci-fi fantasy books, putting together outfits inspired by New York City parks and architecture, and going for long walks with headphones on. They do have cat pictures—just ask.

## Special thanks
Thank you first and most of all to the Dave’s Oral History narrators so far: Patricia Ahn, Dave Dausch, Benham Jones, and Sarose Klein.

Thank you to Carlin Zia, my thesis advisor, and big huge shoutout to my oral history thesis group: Han Powell, Tamara Santibañez, Ornella Baganizi, and Chalay Chalermkraivuth. Your work and conversation have shaped my work and thoughts. I’m so glad I got to thesis with you all.

Thank you to my colleague Moacir P. de Sá Pereira and my dear friend Sam Flax for their big big help with this website, and double thanks to Sam for designing the QR code sticker that leads from the streets of Astoria to this spot on the internet.

Finally, thank you to Ruben "RV" Dougherty, Jon Rooke, and Loa Beckenstein. You each know what you did. :)
